      <p class="text-justify">
        Welcome to <strong>LazyLister</strong> - the to-do list app that knows
        you probably won't get to it today, and that's okay! In a world full of
        productivity apps that make you feel like you're just not doing enough
        with your 24 hours, LazyLister stands out by embracing the art of
        doing...well, the bare minimum.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We understand that sometimes, the most ambitious thing you do in a day
        is make a list of all the ambitious things you're not going to do. And
        we're here for it. <strong>Why Choose Us?</strong>
      </p>
      <h4>Procrastinator-Friendly Features:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Our app is designed with the procrastinator in mind. Enjoy features like
        "Snooze for a Month," "Pretend I Didn’t See That Task," and "Delegate to
        Future Me."
      </p>
      <h4>Motivation, Schmotivation:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Who needs motivation when you have acceptance? Our notifications gently
        remind you that it's okay to not be okay with doing things. "Remember to
        not stress about not doing the thing today. Or tomorrow. No rush."
      </p>
      <h4>Achievement Badges for the Real World:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Earn badges not for completing tasks, but for the creative excuses you
        come up with for not doing them. "Dog Ate My To-Do List," "Was Too Busy
        Thinking About the Universe," and "Decided to Live in the Moment" are
        just a few fan favorites.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Philosophy:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        At LazyLister, we believe that to-do lists shouldn’t be about doing
        more; they should be about stressing less. In a world obsessed with
        productivity, we offer a sanctuary for the serial procrastinators, the
        daydreamers, and the proudly lazy. After all, tomorrow is another
        day...probably.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Promise:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        To always be there for you, ready to capture all the tasks you thought
        about doing and then wisely decided to put off. We're not just an app;
        we're a companion for those moments when ambition strikes, and you need
        somewhere to store it until the feeling passes. So, if you're looking to
        not get a lot done, you're in the right place. Let's embrace the joy of
        procrastination together. Because, in the grand scheme of things, isn't
        putting off till tomorrow what you could do today the ultimate form of
        optimism? Welcome to LazyLister - where tomorrow is the best time to do
        anything.
